## Notes

In some activities, we will ask you to include specific information in the FHIR resource or in a FHIR transaction. In that case, the patient information is detailed on this page or in your profile.

The resource will be posted to a public FHIR server. In case you do not want your information to be posted to this server, you can change this information by editing the optional fields of your profile.

You DO NOT need to modify your name or lastname in the campus. These special fields are located in your optional profile information.
